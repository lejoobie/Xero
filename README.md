# Xero
Xero is an open-source Discord bot, specializing the music for voice channels via the Spotify API.
## About
Xero is a bucket list project for me to explore back-end development. I have always been fascinated by Discord and their automation applications and their many niche
specilizations. Xero is intended to be my own personal music bot, that will also be available for public use to be reprogrammed and repurposed in many iterations for
others to use as needed, for either personal or commercial use, per the MIT license.
### Disclaimer
Xero is a prospective bot, that will continue being innovated for some time, and the time between commits may be lengthy depending on any number of circumstances.
## How To Use
This section will be completed once Xero has a stable release.
## Credits
Xero was created by Jonathan Cales.
This inspiration behind this project comes from other bots such as Dyno, Fredboat, and Rythm.
